Hello, I'm Dan Stefaniuk. I'm a Principal Systems Engineer at NHS England, where I work on digital healthcare services that aim to make a real difference for patients, clinicians, and the wider community. My background covers many areas of technology, from hands-on coding and architecture to building secure, scalable solutions in the cloud. These days, I'm especially focused on software engineering best practices, developer experience, and helping teams work more efficiently.

I started out as a polyglot programmer and full-stack developer, working with different languages and frameworks, and I've had the chance to deliver projects both for large organisations and for smaller, independent clients. Over the years, I've found that what matters most is not just the technology, but how you use it to solve problems and help others grow.

At NHS England, my role has grown to include technical leadership and mentoring, and I spend a lot of time collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. I'm passionate about building things that last, making complex systems easier to understand, and sharing what I've learned along the way.

Recently, I've developed a keen interest in commoditising LLM (large language model) training and fine-tuning, with a particular focus on cost optimisation at the consumer grade level-making it affordable and practical for individuals, not just large enterprises. I believe that by simplifying and standardising how we approach LLMs, we can help more people innovate and get real value from AI in their everyday projects.

I'm always open to connecting with fellow engineers, whether it's to share ideas, tackle interesting challenges, or simply chat about what's new in tech. Outside of work, I'm based in England and enjoy learning, tinkering with new tools, and finding ways to make everyday life a bit simpler.
