I decided to blog. This is long overdue. I should have started this years ago. This begs the question why didn't I? I code at work I code at home. Time is very precious for me... and yes, there are more important things in live than a hobby. But I'm going to try anyway!

There is only one objective, self-improvement. Continuous learning is part of being a good programmer. The world around us changes quickly. Coping with a change is no longer sufficient. We need to embrace it. I believe, keeping notes of what I do will help me gain better understanding of the problems I solve and to overcome fear of the unknown.

Maintain good reading habits and writing a lot of code is one thing. **Being able to explain all of that to others - here is the challenge!**
